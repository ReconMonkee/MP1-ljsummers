# MP1-ljsummers
# Mini-Project 1: Dodge the Creeps
A tutorial implementation by Logan Summers.

This project follows the [Your First Game tutorial from
godotengine.org](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html).

## Project Report
With this project, I found that Godot is actually pretty easy to use. This came as a surprise to me as the only other game engine that I have used is Unity. Which in itself has a pretty big learning curve and I have not yet had enough experience with it.This fact makes me super excited for the rest of this class and I hope I get a lot out of it. 
In terms of any issues I had with Godot, the only problem I ran into was that sometimes you have to save for things to link up. For example, when you have to connect signals from children nodes between 2 scenes, if you do not save then the signal will not show.
